			<em>[Prechorus: Logic]</em><br>
			I've been on the low<br>
			I been taking my time<br>
			I feel like I'm out of my mind<br>
			It feel like my life ain't mine<br>
			<span class=emph>Who can relate?</span><br>
			I've been on the low<br>

			<em>[Chorus: Logic]</em><br>
			I don't wanna be alive<br>
			<span class=red>I don't wanna be alive<br>

			I just wanna die<br>
			I don't wanna be alive<br>
			I don't wanna be alive<br>
			I just wanna die<br>
			And let me tell you why<br>

			<em>[Verse 1: Logic]</em><br>
			All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it<br>
			I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic<br>
			And my life don't even matter<br>
			I know it I know it I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it<br>
			I never had a place to call my own<br>
			I never had a home<br>
			Ain't nobody callin' my phone<br>
			Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?<br>
			They say every life precious but nobody care about mine<br>

			I want you to be alive<br>
			<span class=red>I want you to be alive<br>
			You don't gotta die today</span><br>
			You don't gotta die<br>

			<em>[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]</em><br>
			It's the very first breath<br>
			When your head's been drowning underwater<br>
			And it's the lightness in the air<br>
			When you're there<br>
			Chest to chest with a lover<br>
			It's holding on, though the road's long<br>
			And seeing light in the darkest things<br>
			And when you stare at your reflection<br>
			Finally knowing who it is<br>
			I know that you'll thank God you did<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>[Verse 3: Logic]</em><br>
			I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'<br>
			I know you're the reason I believe in life<br>
			What's the day without a little night?<br>
			I'm just tryna shed a little light<br>
			It can be hard<br>
			It can be so hard<br>
			But you gotta live right now<br>
			You got everything to give right now<br>
		</p>

			<em>[Outro: Khalid]</em><br>
			Pain don't hurt the same, I know<br>
			The lane I travel feels alone<br>
			But I'm moving 'til my legs give out<br>
			And I see my tears melt in the snow<br>
			But I don't wanna cry<br>
			I don't wanna cry anymore<br>
			<span class=red>I wanna feel alive<br>
			I don't even wanna die anymore</span><br>
			Oh I don't wanna<br>
			I don't wanna<br>
			I don't even wanna die anymore<br>
