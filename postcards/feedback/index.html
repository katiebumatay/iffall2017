		<ul>
			<li>Text and images seem disjointed because images are in a box and text is outside the box -- try to have them interact more</li>
			<li>Maybe try photoshopping the figures out of the background so you can put the text in the negative space</li>
			<li>Or make the image big enough to cover the whole space and put the text in the negative space of the image</li>
			<li>It's good that there's a lot of room for the text to wrap as the width gets smaller</li>
			<li>First image has a greenish tint -- make B&W?</li>
			<li>Consider making all the images the same size for consistency</li>
